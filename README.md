# Hello-world
My first repository

My name is Mike, and I am beginning a new adventure. Making a career change, delving into the world of coding, developing and creativity. 

Within two months I will be commencing study with Le Wagon in Bali on a full stack development course for 9 weeks.

Between now and then I need to complete all the prep work, improve my typing speed and organise my move from Bangkok to Canggu.
